👨‍🎓 Personal Introduction

Hello! I'm a university student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering in Australia. 🇮🇹 Originally from Italy, I collaborate with an Italian company on various projects, primarily focused on e-commerce services and implementations. Coding is my passion, and I often spend my time on Leetcode, honing my skills with the aim of becoming an exceptional programmer. As I navigate through my development journey, I'm keen on exploring various aspects of programming.

The quest for a specific language to specialize in continues, but I firmly believe that it's not just about the technologies you know but what you can accomplish with them.

💻 Technical Skills

Languages: PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript
Framework: Cypress for CI/CD testing (primarily for JavaScript/TypeScript projects)
Cloud: AWS for project deployment and management
I'm deeply invested in leveraging these tools to build robust, scalable solutions.

🛠 Projects

Currently, all projects I'm working on are private. However, they span various facets of software development, focusing on creating impactful e-commerce solutions.

🤝 How to Contribute to My Projects

While I'm not looking for direct collaborations at the moment, I'm always open to sharing ideas, experiences, and advice with fellow enthusiasts and professionals.
